# CS UY 2124 Object Oriented Programming
**New York University Tandon School of Engineering** -- Computer Science and Engineering

**Profs. Reeves and Sterling**

## Course Description
This intermediate-level programming course teaches object-oriented programming in C++. Topics: Pointers, dynamic memory allocation and recursion. Classes and objects including constructors, destructors, methods (member functions) and data members. Access and the interface to relationships of classes including composition, association and inheritance. Polymorphism through function overloading operators. Inheritance and templates. Use of the standard template library containers and algorithms.

## Course Objectives
- Design and implement classes in C++
- Inheritance
- Use of pointers, dynamic memory and copy control
- Operator overloading
- Use of the STL
- Exception handling and assertions

## Topics
1. Intro, administrivia, goals, C++: types, conditions, loops, vector, I/O
2. More C++ Basics: Functions, ranged for ref / const, struct
3. Structs and Vectors
4. OOP: classes, data hiding, encapsulation, constructor, const methods
5. OOP: op<<, delegation, nested types
6. Pointers! Addresses, pointer types, address-of, dereference, this, nullptr
7. ->, const with pointers, dynamic memory
8. Copy control: deep vs. shallow, destructor, copy constructor
9. Copy control: Assignment operator. Vector class design
10. Implementing the Vector class, dynamic arrays, pointer arithmetic, push_back
11. Finish vector class: op[], explicit, ranged for support
12. Cyclic association.
13. Separate compilation
14. Operator Overloading
15. Inheritance: substitutability, slicing, polymorphism
16. Inheritance: override, constructors, importance of interface
17. Inheritance: abstract, protected,
18. Inheritance: overloading vs. overriding, poly / non-member
19. Inheritance: inheritance with copy control, polymorphism inside constructors,
20. Inheritance: multiple inheritance; Linked list basics
21. More linked lists
22. Finish Linked lists, Iterators
23. Constant iterators, Templates, STL
24. STL
25. STL; Recursion
26. Recursion
27. Exceptions and Assertions
28. Special Topics


## Notes and Tips:
- It is the first doc I created for my OOP course, uploaded to GitHub for sharing and learning purposes. 
- Each code was commented for learning. If you want to test it, keep in mind the comment symbol and curly brace. 
- Feel free to point my mistakes out and I apologize for them in advance.
