NYU Tandon CS2124 Object-Oriented-Program Notes

This is my first try for the github repository and I hope you can enjoy my notes


Tips:
  1. Each code was commented for learning. If you want to test it, keep in mind the comment symbol and curly brace. 
  2. Feel free to point my mistakes out and I apologize for them in advance.
