# CS UY 2124 Object Oriented Programming
**New York University Tandon School of Engineering** -- Computer Science and Engineering

**Profs. Reeves and Sterling**

## Course Description
Course Pre-requisites: C- or better in CS1134

This intermediate-level programming course teaches object-oriented programming in C++. Topics: Pointers, dynamic memory allocation and recursion. Classes and objects including constructors, destructors, methods (member functions) and data members. Access and the interface to relationships of classes including composition, association and inheritance. Polymorphism through function overloading operators. Inheritance and templates. Use of the standard template library containers and algorithms. | Prerequisite: CS-UY 1134 (C- or better)

## Course Objectives
- Design and implement classes in C++
- Inheritance
- Use of pointers, dynamic memory and copy control
- Operator overloading
- Use of the STL
- Exception handling and assertions

## Topics
- Basics of C++: static typing, conditions, loops, functions, structs and vectors.
- Basic OOP: encapsulation and delegation, methods, data hiding, constructors, const methods, nested types.
- Pointers: addresses, pointer types, pointers and const, dynamic memory
- Copy control: destructor, copy constructor and assignment operator.
- Implementing the vector type: dynamic arrays, pointer arithmetic, index operator, explicit constructor
- Cyclic Association
- Separate compilation
- Operator overloading
- Inheritance
- Iterators
- Implementing linked lists
- Recursion
- Generic Programming: class and function templates
- STL: collections, containers, algorithms, functors, lambda expressions
- Exceptions and assertions

###### Notes and Tips:
- It is the first doc I created for my OOP course, uploaded to GitHub for sharing and learning purposes. 
- Each code was commented for learning. If you want to test it, keep in mind the comment symbol and curly brace. 
- Feel free to point my mistakes out and I apologize for them in advance.
